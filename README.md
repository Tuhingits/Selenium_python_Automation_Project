# Setup Instructions
## Python Setup
You can use any OS: Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

Your requires Python 3.8 or higher. You can download the latest Python version from Python.org.

And also requires pipenv. To install pipenv, run pip install pipenv from the command line.

You should also have a Python editor/IDE of your choice. Good choices include PyCharm and Visual Studio Code.

You will also need Git to copy this project code. If you are new to Git, try learning the basics.

# WebDriver Setup
For Web UI testing, you will need to install the latest versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. You can use other browsers with Selenium WebDriver, but here I use Chrome.
You will also need to install the latest versions of the WebDriver executables for these browsers: ChromeDriver for Chrome and geckodriver for Firefox. Each test case  launch the WebDriver executable for its target browser.

ChromeDriver and geckodriver must be installed on the system path.
